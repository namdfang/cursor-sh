# Reset Cursor ID Script

Scripts to reset identification values in Cursor Editor's storage.json file for Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## Purpose

## Description

These scripts perform the following operations:
- Generate new random IDs for `macMachineId`, `machineId`, and `devDeviceId`
- Update the storage.json file with new values
- Set appropriate file permissions

## Requirements

### Windows
- Windows Operating System
- PowerShell
- Administrator privileges

### Linux/macOS
- Bash shell
- `uuidgen` utility
- Execute permissions

## Storage File Location

The storage.json file is located at:

```plaintext
Windows: %APPDATA%\Cursor\User\globalStorage\storage.json
Linux/macOS: ~/.config/Cursor/User/globalStorage/storage.json
```

## Usage

### Windows
1. Run `reset_cursor_id_windows.bat`
2. If prompted for admin rights, click "Yes"

### Linux/macOS
1. Make the script executable: `chmod +x reset_cursor_id_unix.sh`
2. Run the script: `./reset_cursor_id_unix.sh`

The scripts will automatically:
- Generate new random IDs
- Update the storage.json file
- Display the newly generated IDs

## Features

- Platform-specific implementations (Windows batch & Unix shell script)
- Random UUID generation:
  - Windows: Using PowerShell's Guid
  - Linux/macOS: Using uuidgen or fallback to /dev/urandom
- Random hex string generation for machine IDs
- File permission handling:
  - Windows: Using attrib
  - Linux/macOS: Using chmod
- Automatic error handling and dependency checking

## Important Notes

- Close Cursor Editor before running the script
- The storage.json file will be set to read-only after update
- Backup is created automatically before any modifications

## Example Output

```plaintext
Done! File has been updated with new random values.

New values:
macMachineId: [64-character hex string]
machineId: [64-character hex string]
devDeviceId: [UUID format]
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:
1. Ensure Cursor Editor is closed
2. Run with appropriate permissions
   - Windows: Run as administrator
   - Linux/macOS: Ensure execute permissions (`chmod +x`)
3. Check if the storage.json file exists
4. Verify write permissions in the directory
